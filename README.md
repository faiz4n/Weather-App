A simple weather application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, powered by the OpenWeatherMap API. It allows users to check real-time weather information for any city.

- Displays:
  - Temperature (in Celsius)
  - Humidity
  - Wind Speed
  - Current weather condition icon
- Alerts user if an invalid city name is entered
- Uses async/await with proper error handling

## Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## Why I Built This

This project was created to practice working with APIs, handle asynchronous JavaScript operations, and improve DOM manipulation skills. It also serves as a foundation for more advanced weather-based applications.
